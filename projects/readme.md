# Our ADI Unit Projects

> Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects in ADI, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

Our projects each have an objective, deliverables, and recommendations, and tie in to the overall competencies we focus on in each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files located in each project directory to read more about each project and read more about our curriculum and resources [here](../resources).

See the [feedback guidelines](project-feedback.md) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.


### **Project 1**

Students start the course focusing on the basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is how building for the web started, and it’s an excuse to make sure they’ve got a solid grasp on important fundamentals. To wrap up Unit 1, we build a game, challenging students’ ability to create a responsive layout using HTML and CSS, and to write complex and interesting jQuery to implement game logic. We'll give them at least 3 game specs to choose from.

We'll make sure everyone's up to speed on HTML5 and has a thorough understanding of using CSS – and using it _well_. So many graduates have gotten jobs because their projects caught an employer's eye, so giving them a lot of time to get good at implementing designs and interfaces on the front end will be a huge improvement and set them up to make all of their projects that much more impressive.

  - **Goal**: Build a todo list app that allows users to create, edit and delete list items and displays correctly on portrait and landscape layouts.
  - **Project Time**: 3 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](project-01)**


### **Project 2**

For the mid-course project, we build and deploy a standard, secured CRUD app. We currently cover Ruby and Rails in this unit, focusing on mastering key concepts in object-oriented programming, MVC design patterns, and relational data modeling prior to moving on to modern full-stack web development in JavaScript.

The second unit project is an individual project. We'll give students several project specs to choose from and help them scope the project appropriately, but also invite students to exercise a little more creativity.

  - **Goal**: Build a full-stack CRUD app in Rails, that interacts with a database and includes at least a few relationships between models, server-side rendering of templates, and encryption & authentication.
  - **Project Time**: 4 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](project-02.md)**


### **Project 3**

In the third project, students work in groups to build a custom API built with Express & MongoDB, consumed on the front-end by jQuery. The project challenges teams’ ability to work creatively and contribute code in a collaborative workflow. Students typically incorporate oAuth workflows and third-party APIs into their project.

We do a demo day at the end of the week and we invite a couple local professional developers to sit in and provide feedback for students when they present. We order in lunch and make it a big thing, and a practice round for the end-of-course demo day.

  - **Goal**: Collaborate with a small team to build a product MVP. You will be assigned a team and will design and architect a solution in tandem with your instructors, choosing an appropriate set of technologies to build your chosen product.
  - **Project Time**: 5 days (full week)
  - **[Detailed Spec File](project-03.md)**


### **Project 4** *(Weeks 11-12)*

The final project is all about helping students apply their knowledge and skills in a personal project that focuses on the areas in which they want to center their job search. Week 11 is a critical time for students to meet up with their career coach. They should also have a 1:1 with an instructor to talk through their plan for their portfolio project.

  - **Goal**: Build a portfolio project that looks really good and is the cornerstone of your portfolio. Choose from the many things learned over the course to implement a really creative project.
  - **Project Time**: 5 days (full week)
