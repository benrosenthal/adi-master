#### Overview

Project 3 is your opportunity to really let your creativity shine! You will have the basic requirements, but it is up to you to design everything. This app will allow the user to create a travel itinerary and show the user points of interest near their location while they are on their trip. You will also have the opportunity to integrate various APIs, including Maps, Calendar, and Foursquare.

**You will be working in a group for this project**. The project will be spread across **three weeks**, with separate deliverables due at the end of each week. Although the deliverables will be separate, we will be incorporating them all into a single app, expanding upon the previous week's work. The first week will focus on the user interface and cloud syncing, the second week on integrating the various APIs, and the third will tie everything together.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Include **at least 2 prototypes**
- Include user stories for the **complete flow of your app**
- Allow the user to make a list of items, sorted by date to represent the itinerary
- Allow the user to see points of interested near them while on vacation using the Foursquare API
- Allow the user to sync their travel itinerary to the cloud
- Allow the user to share their itinerary with other people
- Integrate **at least one other API** (Maps, Calendar, etc.)
- Push notifications to the user when near pre-defined points of interest, or those provided by Foursquare
- Include automated (and manual testing if needed) to cover your app.


**Bonus:**

- Integrate more than one API
- Make your app work with Android Wear

#### Necessary Deliverables

**Week 1:**

- Team formation 
- User stories
- A **completed, basic version of the user interface for your app**, with placeholder data and resources to fill out your screens.
- Working cloud synchronization using Sync Adapters

**Week 2:**

- Project plan that is peer-reviewed according to the format discussed in class
- Feedback on UX
- Integration of your chosen API(s)
- Integration of Foursquare

**Week 3:**

- A final, working version of your app.
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** describing what the app does, and any bugs that may exist.
- One screenshot in the ``readme.md``
- Testing code

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Complete as much of the layout as possible before working on your logic.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
- Test functionality as soon as you complete it

#### Example Deliverable

Below you can find an example of what the instructors' final product looks like. **Be creative with your own designs!**

**SCREENSHOTS WILL BE ADDED SOON**

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 27 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
