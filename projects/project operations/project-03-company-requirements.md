##Project #3 Company Requirements

### Overview

Android Development Immersive (ADI) is a hands-on, project-based learning experience that allows students to become professional Android Developers.

In order to simulate the most realistic dev environment possible in the classroom, we're partnering with companies to provide sponsored project briefs as part of the third project in the Android Development Immersive. Students will work on these project briefs in order to apply the skills that they've learned over the previous 5 weeks of the program.

Here's how you can help:

---

### Sponsor Requirements

As a sponsor company, you must be able to provide:

* A project overview clearly describing your company and your project
* Design spec and assets (including logos, brand guidelines, etc.)
* An API relevant to the project brief
* An automated test suite for students to test their code

Please see an example of a completed project in the [example project folder](../../templates/example-project). Note: Ignore the solution code!  We will only be asking for a project description, in the form of a readme, and a test suite.

### Submitting Your Project

* Use [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/ZfUESK) in order to submit the project overview and contact information (you can submit as many projects as you'd like)
* We'll schedule a meeting or call in order to help you scope out the project and create user stories
* Over the next 2 months, we'll ask you to submit any required design assets and specs for the project as well as the API

### What Happens During Project #3

Students will be assigned a sponsored company and work in small groups (3 to 4 developers on each team) in order to complete the project.

Students will work through the project brief by completing user research, prototyping, and then building the app itself. All of this will be done with little to no involvement from the sponsor company.

Students will then present their processes and apps to their classmates and instructors.

While apps created at the end of this project will **not** be allowed to be submitted to the Google Play Store, students must be able to present these apps on their portfolios and during hiring opportunities.
