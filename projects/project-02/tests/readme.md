We will be doing **manual testing** for this project, because Espresso contains bugs when interacting with the android.support.v7.widget.SearchView.

For manual testing, the process is broken down into two categories: Steps for testing, and expected results. Each step has an expected result.

Example:

**Step 1**: Click on Search icon in the top right corner.	**Expected**: Text box appears and keyboard shows on the screen.

Each test case contains these sequences of steps and expected results until the expected end result is shown. You will write individual test cases for each feature of your app. Included in this directory are two example text files which test a few features in each activity.

**Ask the instructors for help if you need help!**
