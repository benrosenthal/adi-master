# General Assembly's Android Development Immersive

Welcome, ADI 1 from NYC!  

In this repository, you'll find notes from in-class lessons to help you practice and review the topics we teach.

Take a look at a few links we'll be using throughout class:

- [Class Trello](https://trello.com/b/5i1LaVTy/adi-1-nyc) - this is where you can find the class schedule, week to week.
- [Tuesday/Thursday Exit Tickets](http://goo.gl/forms/LuPZuy7jD0) - used to gauge student learning bi-weekly and help inform the instructional team on how to best format flex sessions and morning exercises
- [Reflection Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/BqC4iulHzn) - done every Friday to take a step away from the content

## Instructors, read below

Set an upstream remote to the [master repository](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/adi-curriculum).  After you've fetched recent additions to the course, be sure to run the `transform.sh` file to remove solution code and instructor comments before adding and committing your changes.
