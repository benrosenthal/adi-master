## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab you will be using your knowledge of classes to build an app that utilizes an Animal class, complete with properties, getters and setters. After completing the class, you will instantiate your Animal and use the getters and setters to fill out TextViews.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an Animal class with the following properties: numLegs, topSpeed, isEndangered, name
- Complete the constructor for the Animal class
- Create all getters and setters for the Animal  properties
- Instantiate an Animal in your activity's onCreate, and display some of its properties in a TextView
- Use the setter methods to modify some of the animal's properties and show the modified animal in a second TextView

**Bonus:**
- Add additional methods to your Animal class that return a formatted String using the class properties.

#### Starter code

You will need to complete the constructor, getters and setters in the provided Animal.java file. MainActivity.java contains comments guiding you on the code you need to write.

#### Deliverable

Make your app look like the screenshot below, following the requirements above.
