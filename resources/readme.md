# Global Materials


Most of the materials in this folder are referenced in our baseline course plan on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/F1PpxTzE/adi-beta-program-curriculum). Take a look.  Lessons, labs, and other resources are organized by Standard in the appropriate subfolders.

Tips for browsing the links below:

- The resources are linked to their location: clicking the link will take you to the lesson/lab readme, any starter/solution code, and tests.
- Resource links with a "+" are suggested topics for that time block and do not have an existing baseline resource. We'd love for you to contribute a resource with a pull request.
- Resource links with a "#" are time blocks dedicated for outcomes lessons. Coordinate with your local outcomes teams to fill these slots.
- Resource links with a "@" are resources from other courses that need to be adapted for ADI
- Resource links with a "*" are resources that are currently being worked on
- This baseline scope and sequence of the curriculum is based on the following:

  - a 9am-5pm day with a lunch break from 1-2pm

    - 9-10am represents a one hour session typically occupied by an exercise, introduction, reflection, and sometimes, a short lesson
    - 10am-1pm and 2-5pm are dedicated to lessons, labs, and outcomes sessions
    - Two holidays taken on *week 2, day 5* and *week 6, day 5*

## Unit 1

In this unit, students will be practicing the basics of XML, how to navigate an OS, version control, and foundational programming concepts in Java/Android that we'll use for the entire rest of the course.

As it stands now, pre-work consists of workshops and third party resources that reinforce programming fundamentals for Android, so n this unit, we review data types, functions, and other foundational concepts in Java.

Another goal of this unit is also to get students comfortable creating and manipulating layouts, activities, and intents as well as paper prototyping and iterating on a design.

##### Project 1

Student will be building their very first Android app - a todo list app - that runs on a real Android device!

This project will be split into two phases. First, students will be creating two iterations of a paper prototype. Then, you will be drawing the design of each screen, as well as describing what happens when the user interacts with each element on the screen. Students will receive instructor feedback after each iteration.  Second, you will be coding the app itself. Students will implement the design they created in the first step using all of the knowledge gained during weeks one and two.

- **Goal**: Build a todo list app
- **Project Time**: 3 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-01/readme.md)**

##### Project 2

For project 2, students will be creating an app that integrates many different technologies and principles. This app will allow the user to search for places in their neighborhood (descriptions and images) based on street names, neighborhood names, neighborhood types...it's up to the student!

This is another individual project and the project will be spread across four weeks, with separate deliverables due at the end of each week. Although the deliverables will be separate, we will be incorporating them all into a single app, expanding upon the previous week's work. The first week will focus on the user interface, the second week on the back-end database and JUnit tests, and the third will tie everything together.

- **Goal**: Create a neighborhood navigation and search app
- **Project Time**: 4 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-02/readme.md)**

##### Project 3

Students have already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time, students will be challenged to work on a whole project with a small team.  Instructors will partner students with other classmates, and students will use research provided by partner companies and architect, design, and collaboratively build an app of their own design.

This project is meant to push students both technically and collaboratively.

- **Goal**: Work as a team using agile methodologies to create an Android application
- **Project Time**: 5 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-03/readme.md)**

##### Project 4

Students will get to call the shots and come up with their own idea, choosing tools that are appropriate for what they're looking to build.

For this project, students will be working with a team and using product development strategies to come up with a project proposal that will be reviewed with the instructional team; this it to make sure the team's proposal is something that can be accomplish in the time left in the course while also making sure it's something that will challenge students.

- **Goal**: Do user research and use product development methods to pitch an idea that will turn into a working Android app
- **Project Time**: 5 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-04/readme.md)**
